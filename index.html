		<h2>Game Development</h2>
		<p>I've always been fascinated by game development, so naturally I want to take it on as a career. I picked up Unity in my spare time and love the small games I've built with it. While I’ve spent a substantial amount of my career in Hospitality, I strive to become a Game Developer.</p>
		<h2>Travel</h2>
		<p>After traveling and living in Japan for over a year in 2023 I have discovered how much I enjoy seeing the ways other people live all over the world. I hope to be able to visit all kinds of other places such as Taiwan and South Korea.</p>
		<h2>Learning</h2>
		<p>I love learning new things! I think that's why I enjoy making video games so much, it really is all about learning. Recently I have been trying to learn some 3D modeling to bring more life to my games and it has been very hard but crazy fun.</p>
		<h2>Anime</h2>
		<p>Massive anime fan, I love watching anime! I spent a lot of time in high school watching anime and trying to learn animation. I remember just how much effort it took just for a few frames and boy was that too much effort for one high schooler! I learned a great deal from that though and really helps me appreate the art even more!</p>

			<a href="GodVsGravity/index.html">
				<img src="Pictures/gamepic6.png" alt="God Vs Gravity" width="250" height="140">
			</a>
			<p>God Vs Gravity - This was my submission to the GMTK 2023 Game Jam. I spent some time after the Jam to add some polish. This was my first time in a Game Jam and I really appreciate the experience I got from making this. I plan on making a game for the next GMTK Game Jam.</p>

		<div class="pbox">
			<a href="Justins Peanut Factory/index.html">
				<img src="Pictures/gamepic5.png" alt="Justins Peanut Factory" width="250" height="140">
			</a>
			<p>Justins Peanut Factory - I am a big fan of games where the goal is just to make numbers go up. It's such a simple concept yet it can make such a fun gameplay loop! This was my first attempt at making a cookie clicker game.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="pbox">
			<a href="Bouncing Gage/index.html">
				<img src="Pictures/gamepic4.png" alt="Bouncing Gage" width="250" height="140">
			</a>
			<p>Bouncing Gage - This was a quick project after a couple of other prototypes that I did not finish. I think it's very important to finish projects before trying other things and I wanted to make sure I could still make something simple with a little polish and mark as complete.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="pbox">
			<a href="Paper Wars/index.html">
				<img src="Pictures/gamepic3.png" alt="Paper Wars" width="250" height="140">
			</a>
			<p>Paper Wars - This was my first attempt at making a game without following a tutorial. This might have been the project that taught me the most about making games and just how much fun it could be!</p>
		</div>

		<div class="pbox">
			<a href="Game 3/index.html">
				<img src="Pictures/gamepic2.png" alt="Sticky Walls" width="250" height="140">
			</a>
			<p>Sticky Walls - My second attempt at making a game. I watched a tutorial for a large portion of development but I started adding my own elements and changing things from the tutorial. Overall I am very happy with how this one turned out.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="pbox">
			<a href="CubeGame/index.html">
				<img src="Pictures/gamepic1.png" alt="Cube Game" width="250" height="140">
			</a>
			<p>Cube Game the Game - The first game I ever made. I am sure many people started with the same game before as it comes from a very popular tutorial, I learned so much starting here and I am so glad that I have this to show from it.</p>
